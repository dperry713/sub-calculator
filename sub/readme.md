# Enhanced Subwoofer Design Tool

## Overview

The **Enhanced Subwoofer Design Tool** is a graphical user interface (GUI) application developed in Python using Tkinter. This tool assists users in designing subwoofer enclosures by calculating optimal volume and port dimensions based on Thiele/Small parameters. It provides a user-friendly interface for inputting parameters, performing calculations, and visualizing frequency response.

## Features

- Input fields for Thiele/Small parameters:
  - Fs (Resonant Frequency)
  - Qts (Total Q Factor)
  - Vas (Equivalent Volume of Air)
  - Xmax (Maximum Linear Excursion)
- Option to select enclosure type (sealed or ported).
- Calculation of recommended box volume and port dimensions.
- Frequency response visualization using Matplotlib.
- Save and load designs in JSON format.
- Input validation to ensure all parameters are positive and valid.
- Tooltips for user guidance on input fields.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (comes with Python)
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- JSON (built-in Python library)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install the required libraries if not already installed:

   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib numpy
python enhanced_subwoofer_design_tool.py
Usage
Enter the Thiele/Small parameters in the provided input fields.
Select the enclosure type (sealed or ported).
For ported enclosures, enter the desired tuning frequency (Fb) and port diameter.
Click the Calculate button to compute the recommended box volume and port dimensions.
View the frequency response plot.
Use the Save Design button to save your parameters to a JSON file.
Use the Load Design button to load previously saved designs.
Clear the input fields using the Clear button.
Example
For a subwoofer with the following parameters:

Fs: 30 Hz
Qts: 0.5
Vas: 50 liters
Xmax: 12 mm
Enclosure Type: Ported
Desired Tuning Frequency (Fb): 35 Hz
Port Diameter: 10 cm
The tool will provide the recommended box volume and port length along with a frequency response plot.
